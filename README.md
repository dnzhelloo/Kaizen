# Climate Awareness AR Project

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to raise awareness about the climate crisis. To achieve this objective, we have decided to employ Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Our main aim is to educate individuals and bring to life what the future might look like in the face of this crisis. Currently, we are using the AI-based Skybox method to visualize the temporary environment, but our ultimate vision is to show the current news and the environmental impacts of each product. Users will be able to click on items and experience the real-time CO2 data.

## Hackathon Entry

We have entered this project in the Technology for Sustainability Hackathon, where we aim to showcase the potential of technology in addressing sustainability challenges. As part of our participation, we have created this README on our GitHub account to provide an overview of our project and its objectives.

## Usage

To experience our Climate Awareness AR Project, follow these steps:

1. Install the AR application on your compatible device.
2. Launch the application and point your device's camera at the designated area.
3. Use the AR interface to click on various products and explore their associated news and environmental impacts. (still working)
4. Interact with the AR elements to learn more about the current CO2 data. (still working)
